# Implement Uplift Decision Tree with DeltaDeltaP Split

This is a demo for the uplift decision tree with DeltaDeltaP split. The example data is from https://github.com/sibmike/uplift, and the preds is based on these hyperparameters:

- max_depth = 3
- min_samples_leaf = 6000
- min_samples_leaf_trated = 2500
- min_samples_leaf_control = 2500
